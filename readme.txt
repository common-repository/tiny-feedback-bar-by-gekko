When using Google Chrome you can click F12 to show Developer Tools. Click the Console tab and reload the page.

If you see any messages like:
Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new c.fn.init(a,b)} has no method ‘contextMenu’
or
Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method ‘on’

jQuery is known to have a conflict when multiple versions of jQuery are loaded.

= Credits: Yoast.com =
This is my first major plugin and - as you know - all beginnings are hard.
To make a smooth start, I looked into the most succesful Wordpress plugins
around to see how these were build. 

The biggest lessons were the one that I learned from Wordpress SEO - in 
my mind - the best SEO plugin around. As you probably know, that is written 
by a fellow Dutchie: Joost de Valk or 'Yoast' as most of you know him.

Tiny Feedback Bar has the same structure as I foun in Wordpress SEO by Yoast 
for which I want to thank Yoast. Because without that example, I would have 
lost ALL my hairs. Those of you who know me know what that means.

I hope you will all enjoy the plugin as much as we already have. Have fun!
